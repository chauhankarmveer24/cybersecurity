NETWORK TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE
============================

1. BASIC NETWORK INFORMATION
---------------------------
ipconfig                    # Basic IP configuration
ipconfig /all              # Detailed IP configuration
ipconfig /release          # Release current IP
ipconfig /renew            # Request new IP

2. CONNECTIVITY TESTING
----------------------
ping 127.0.0.1             # Test localhost
ping [IP address]          # Test specific IP
ping [hostname]            # Test hostname resolution
ping -t [IP]               # Continuous ping

3. DNS AND NAME RESOLUTION
-------------------------
nslookup [domain]          # DNS lookup
nslookup -type=MX [domain] # Check mail servers
nslookup -type=NS [domain] # Check name servers

4. NETWORK PATH ANALYSIS
-----------------------
tracert [hostname]         # Trace route to host
pathping [hostname]        # More detailed path analysis

5. NETWORK STATISTICS
--------------------
netstat -an                # Show all connections
netstat -b                 # Show programs using connections
netstat -r                 # Show routing table

6. ARP (ADDRESS RESOLUTION PROTOCOL)
----------------------------------
arp -a                     # Show ARP table
arp -d [IP]                # Delete ARP entry

7. NETWORK RESET COMMANDS
------------------------
ipconfig /flushdns         # Clear DNS cache
ipconfig /registerdns      # Register DNS
netsh winsock reset        # Reset Winsock catalog

8. FIREWALL AND PORT TESTING
---------------------------
telnet [host] [port]       # Test specific port
netstat -an | findstr LISTENING  # Show listening ports

TROUBLESHOOTING STEPS
====================

1. Start with Basic Configuration
   - Run 'ipconfig' to check your current network settings
   - Verify IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway
   - Ensure you have a valid IP address (not 169.254.x.x)

2. Test Local Connectivity
   - Ping localhost (127.0.0.1) to verify network stack
   - Ping your default gateway to check local network
   - Ping other devices on your network

3. Check DNS Resolution
   - Use nslookup to verify DNS is working
   - Try pinging a domain name (e.g., google.com)
   - Check if DNS servers are properly configured

4. Test Internet Connectivity
   - Ping a public IP (e.g., 8.8.8.8)
   - Use tracert to see where connection might fail
   - Check if you can access websites

5. Check Network Services
   - Use netstat to check active connections
   - Verify no firewall is blocking required ports
   - Check if required services are running

COMMON ISSUES AND SOLUTIONS
==========================

1. No Internet Access
   - Check if you have a valid IP address
   - Verify default gateway is correct
   - Try releasing and renewing IP
   - Check DNS settings

2. Slow Network
   - Use tracert to identify slow hops
   - Check for network congestion
   - Verify no background programs using bandwidth
   - Check for malware or viruses

3. DNS Issues
   - Flush DNS cache
   - Try different DNS servers
   - Check DNS server configuration
   - Verify network connectivity

4. Connection Drops
   - Check physical connections
   - Verify network adapter settings
   - Check for IP conflicts
   - Monitor network stability

5. Firewall Issues
   - Check Windows Firewall settings
   - Verify antivirus settings
   - Check router firewall settings
   - Test with firewall temporarily disabled

SAFETY PRECAUTIONS
=================
- Always run commands in a safe environment
- Be careful with network reset commands
- Document changes before making them
- Have a backup plan for network changes
- Don't disable security features without proper consideration

Remember: Always run these commands with appropriate permissions and be careful when modifying network settings.
